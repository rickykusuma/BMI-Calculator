        How to calculate Body Mass Index Body Mass Index is a simple calculation
        using a person’s height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg
        is a person’s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres
        squared. A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is
        18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years.
